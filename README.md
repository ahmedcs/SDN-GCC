# SDN-GCC
SDN-GCC is a SDN-based Generic Congestion Control for Data Centre Networks. 
Specifically, it aims at implementing a transport-agnostic congestion control mechanism and achieving coperation between the network SDN controller and hypervisor to perform rate control of various flows at the hypervisor level.

It is implemented as a netwok application running on top of Ryu-Controller as well as a small Patch to Open vSwitch data-path.
